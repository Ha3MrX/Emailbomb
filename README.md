### What is A Email bomb


### Email bomb depending on the magnitude can be a form of prank or an actual denial of service attack.
There are three ways to create an email bomb Mass mailing - involves sending numerous duplicates of the 
same email to one email address. Because of the simplicity of this attack it can be easily detected by spam filters
To be done on a massive scale, an attacker can use a bot net or zombie net, computers across the globe
which are under the attacker’s control due to some form of malware such as Trojans, and then instructing the bot net to
send millions of emails to a single or a few addresses at once in order to perform a denial of service attack
This is harder for spam filters to detect since each email would be coming from a unique source
